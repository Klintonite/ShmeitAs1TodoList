Used and altered Lonely Twitter code from lab for some parts of my project, Also used Dr. Hindleâ€™s code from the student picker saga for some aspects. 
Must compile with Appcompat_v7. When loading the project open both the todo list and app compat in eclipse
choose the todolist properties and go to android buildpath. choose android 4.2.2 API 17. Under Library remove the reference if it is not working and add 
the current appcompat_v7
that is imported in eclipse. Clean and run.
